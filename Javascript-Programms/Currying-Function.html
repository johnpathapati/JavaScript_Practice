    <!-- What is Currying?

    Currying is a technique in functional programming where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a
    series of functions, each taking a single argument. This means that instead of calling a function with all arguments
    at once, you call a sequence of functions that each take one argument at a time.

    In a typical function, you might pass multiple arguments at once:
    
    Benefits of Currying

    Modularity: Breaking down functions into smaller, single-argument functions makes them easier to reuse.
    Readability: Curried functions can make it clear which argument is fixed or partially applied.
    Customization: You can partially apply functions for specific use cases without rewriting or overloading them.

    When to Use Currying Use currying when:

    You want to create reusable, partially-applied functions.
    You need to use the same function in different configurations.
    Youâ€™re working with higher-order functions or functional programming patterns where composability and modularity are
    prioritized. -->

        function add1(a, b) {
            return a + b;
        }
        console.log(add1(2, 3)); // Output: 5

        //With currying, you transform add so it takes one argument at a time:

        function add(a) {
            return function (b) {
                return a + b;
            };
        }

        const addTwo = add(2); // addTwo is now a function that takes one argument
        console.log(addTwo(3)); // Output: 5


        //Converting a Normal Function to a Curried Function

        function curry(func) { //func === This is the original function that you want to "curry" or transform into a curried version.  The func parameter is passed into the curry function when you call it, so it refers to the function that needs to be curried.
            return function curried(...args) { // The ...args is the rest parameter. It collects all the arguments passed to the curried function at any given call.
                if (args.length >= func.length) {
                    return func(...args); //The func(...args) uses the spread operator (...args) to pass all the collected arguments to the original function.
                }
                return function (...nextArgs) {
                    return curried(...args, ...nextArgs);
                };
            };

        const curriedSum = curry(sum);
        console.log(curriedSum(1)(2)(3));
        console.log(curriedSum(1, 2)(3));
        console.log(curriedSum(1, 2, 3));
