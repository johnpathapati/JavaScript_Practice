        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>
    <script>
        var parentList = document.getElementById("myList");
        
        //addEventListener is a JavaScript method that attaches a function to run when a specified event occurs on an element.
        parentList.addEventListener("click",handleItemClick);

        function handleItemClick(event){
            var target = event.target; //Logic : In an event delegation pattern, event.target helps identify which element within parentList was clicked. In this case, event.target would be the <li> element that was clicked
            console.log("Clicked:",target.textContent); // By printing target.textContent, we provide feedback on which item was clicked
            //1.target represents the clicked <li> item. 
            //2.textContent pulls just the text from that <li> item
        }

    </script>
    <!-- Full Logic Explanation
    The code uses event delegation to manage click events for multiple <li> elements within a single <ul> parent container. Instead of attaching individual click event listeners to each <li>, it attaches one listener to the parent <ul> element. When a click occurs on any <li>, the event bubbles up to the <ul>, triggering the handleItemClick function.
    
    Efficiency: Event delegation is more efficient because it reduces the number of event listeners, especially helpful when dealing with large numbers of similar elements.
    Dynamic Content Handling: If you add new <li> elements to parentList, theyâ€™ll automatically be covered by the same event listener, without any additional code. -->
