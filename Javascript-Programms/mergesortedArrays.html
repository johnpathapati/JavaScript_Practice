<!-- How the Comparison Function Works:
Comparison function (a, b) => a - b:

If the result of a - b is negative, it means that a is smaller than b, and a should come before b.
If the result of a - b is positive, it means that b is smaller than a, and b should come before a.
If the result of a - b is 0, it means that a and b are equal, and their order doesn't need to be changed.
Example: Let's say we want to sort the array [1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8].

Initially, the array looks like: [1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8]
After applying .sort((a, b) => a - b):
The sort() function compares the numbers:
1 - 3 is negative → 1 comes before 3
3 - 5 is negative → 3 comes before 5
5 - 7 is negative → 5 comes before 7
2 - 4 is negative → 2 comes before 4
and so on…
The sorted array becomes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] -->
